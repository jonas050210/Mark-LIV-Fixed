"""
MARK LIV — one-time setup.

Use ``python setup.py --check`` for an offline, non-destructive validation of
Python compatibility, requirements, and shipped assets. Without ``--check``
the script installs dependencies and optionally downloads Playwright browsers.

Installs the Python dependencies for THIS operating system only: the OS-specific
packages in requirements.txt carry `sys_platform` markers, so a macOS or Linux
user never pulls Windows-only libraries (and vice-versa). Then it fetches the
Playwright browsers needed for web automation (current-OS builds only).

Two things it deliberately does NOT install:
  * the optional local wake word ("Hey Jarvis") — one-click, opt-in, from
    ⚙ → WAKE WORD inside the app;
  * anything for the avatar — the holographic head renders in software on the
    PyQt6 and numpy already listed here. No GPU, no OpenGL, no extra packages.
