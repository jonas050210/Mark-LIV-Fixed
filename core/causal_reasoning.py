"""
core/causal_reasoning.py — a causal-link graph that augments Jarvis's
autonomous decision-making with cause-and-effect analysis of screen events
and the tool calls that follow them.

WHAT THIS IS, PRECISELY
    core/predictive_assistant.py already mines "A is usually followed by B"
    bigrams from workflow_events, but only over tool calls, and it only ever
    reports raw confidence (count(A->B) / count(A)). That number cannot tell
    "B follows A because A causes it" apart from "B just happens to be common
    on its own, and would follow almost anything" — a screen alert that
    fires constantly will look "caused" by whatever else is also constant.

    This module adds the missing half: LIFT. lift(A->B) = confidence(A->B) /
    base_rate(B), i.e. how much more often B follows A than B happens anyway.
    A link with lift near 1.0 is coincidence; a link with high confidence AND
    high lift is the closest a frequency-counting system can get to "A
    actually drives B" without running a controlled experiment. This is
    still a heuristic, not verified causal inference (no do-calculus, no
    randomized intervention) — the API is named and documented honestly so
    nothing downstream mistakes correlation-with-lift for proof.

    It is fed by two event streams that predictive_assistant does not see
    together: `tool:<name>` events (mirrored from the same dispatch main.py
    already logs to predictive_assistant) and `screen:<watch_for>` events
    (from actions/screen_monitor.py's alerts). Putting both in one timeline
    is what lets Jarvis learn things like "after screen:download_finished,
    tool:open_app usually follows" — a genuinely cause-shaped fact that
    neither existing event log could produce alone, because each only ever
    saw one half of the story.

HOW IT'S USED
    - actions/screen_monitor.py calls record_event() when an alert fires.
    - main.py's _dispatch_tool calls record_event() alongside its existing
      predictive_assistant.log_event() call (same best-effort try/except).
    - actions/causal_insight.py exposes explain()/predict_effects() as a tool
      so the model can consult learned cause-effect structure before
      deciding what to do next, instead of guessing — that consultation is
      the "augmented autonomous decision-making" this module provides.
      Nothing here executes anything on its own; it only informs.
